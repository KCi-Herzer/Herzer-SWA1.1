This is my 1.1 Discussion Board - Source Control assignment for SWE Online
Here is a list of 5 projects I found intresting on GitHub.

https://github.com/github/gitignore
This project is to give users templates for using .gitignore. They contain links
to helpful resources in the README.md file on how to use .gitignore. I will need to
take the time to look into this more in the future.

https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks
I like this project because it's used to translate Steamworks.net funtionality
from C++ to C# inorder for users to access Steam multiplayer funtionality
on their Unity projects.

https://github.com/DapperDino/Mirror-Multiplayer-Tutorials
This is a repository on a series of titorials made by the YouTuber DapperDino.
He uses this to help teach new game developers how to use Mirror in their
Unity projects.

https://github.com/demon071/Tiktok-API-Python
I found this project intresting because it allows you to download TikTok videos
without the TikTok watermark you'll usually get when downloading a video. I 
wont ever use this, but it's intresting to see how this can be done.

https://github.com/HungryTurtleCode/multiplayerSnake
This project is made by Hungry Turtle Code on YouTube. He has a tutorial on
how to make a multiplayer snake game using Socket. I have not worked with Java
yet, so it is intresting to look at some of his code.
